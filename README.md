# VKR
Non-Negative Matrix Factorization Improved Kernel Regression for Side Effect Prediction
ipynb for review of ADRs prediciton study and VKR.

# .ipynb file
The .ipynb files are for generating the results of ADRs prediction using multiple models, including the Naive model (Claculating Mean across drugs as prediction of a ADR), Kernel Regression(KR), Support Vector Machine (SVM) wiith kernel Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, Linear kernel and Weighted Generalized T-Student (WGTS) kernel, Linear Neighbourhood Similarity Method (LNSM) with different feature combination methods including Cost Minimization Integration method (CMI) and Similarity Matrix Integration (SMI) method. Further more, we also built .ipynb files for genereting figures, as well as the p-values for methods comparison.

## ADRs Prediction

The code for ADRs prediction were built based on different models. Here are the .ipynb files for generating the results of nested CV and the independent test sets 
for the models.
